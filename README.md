# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

Aspect-based sentiment analysis goes one step further than sentiment analysis by automatically assigning sentiments to specific features or topics. It involves breaking down text data into smaller fragments, allowing you to obtain more granular and accurate insights from your data. 

This model consists of two modules located in their respective sub-folders:
* Aspect classifier

* Sentiment classifier

The steps for setting up the environment and training the modules are located in the README files located in their respective sub-folders.
